We are proud to announce that we are organizing a new project activity in collaboration with AEA, the Polimi Automation and Robotics Association!
We would like to create a team which will become familiar with the tools and resources of Duckietown, a foundation with the objective of spreading knowledge about robotics and machine learning!
The final objective of the team is to take part in the AI Driving Olympics, where you will have to teach a mini car to drive itself inside a circuit.
