Hi #PMDSer! ü•ÅA new event is out and... we are back at PoliMi!ü•≥ Join us for a hands-on workshop where you‚Äôll learn how to leverage cloud technologies for your machine learning and data science projects. We‚Äôll focus on the real-world tools available on AWS to train and deploy ML models to a scalable production environment. Starting from a sample ML model, we‚Äôll dive into the challenges faced by organizations when building end-to-end ML pipelines, offering you an opportunity to build hands-on experience and be ready for the job market. You‚Äôll be able to run the workshop for free on your laptop using free AWS Credits in your AWS account (or a temporary account provided by AWS). The event will be held in presence at polimi in room 3.1.7 in campus Leonardo, from 16:00. Hurry up, the seats are limited!
