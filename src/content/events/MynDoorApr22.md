PMDS and E-Club are working together for a new event!
Myndoor - an amazing startup which aims at monitoring, predicting and preventing stress and psychological distress by using Natural Language Processing methods - will come in presence at Polimi Leonardo to talk about their experience and approach in the business and data science field.
The event will be structured in two parts, starting from the story of the startup and the business model, to then focus on the more technical side related to how to build a ML model to analyze the stress levels and do sentiment analysis through guided notebooks and the support of the team.
Please bring you computer for the second part as you will have the chance to practice your programming skills (no software is required)!
Come with us discovering Myndoor and the power of NLP
