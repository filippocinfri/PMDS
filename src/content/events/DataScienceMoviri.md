Hello PMDSers, get ready to come to the Moviri Terrace for another great event!

Have you ever wondered how many possible applications does ML offer?
Here at these event we will analyze three interesting case studies proposed by Moviri, global leader in providing services and software in the markets of IT performance optimization, recommender systems, and security.

The event is divided in three different parts:
What is ContentWise and what does it offer to its client
Fraud detection in the streaming market: how to discover suspicious behaviors of users
Bayesian Optimization for performance autotuning
At the end of the event, stay with us for a wonderful aperitivo on the Moviri Terrace!
