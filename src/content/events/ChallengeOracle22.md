Hello PMDSers ðŸ”¥
Ready to start the new semester with a blast?
Save the date: 8th March 2022 from 16.30 to 19.30

We have organized a new event with Oracle where we invite you to challenge yourself by solving a real customer segmentation problem.
You will be guided by Oracle throughout the entire process, for which they will provide some notebooks and hints.

For a company is really important to understand the customers you are dealing with on a daily basis.
This will help in adapting the enterprise behavior in order to accustom customers' needs.

The event will be held both in presence, where there will be the Oracle staff, and remotely on zoom.
